RANGES

Range method will iterate from the start val to the stop val 
and step-thru by the step val.
Note - if no start val is passed or less than 3 args are passed, 
Python assumes starting point is 0, defaul step value is 1


range(start, stop, step)

for i in range(0,10,1)
    print(i)

Ranges are EXclusive of stop values, so the loop above will not run / output of 10,
only values 0 thru 9 will be printed.

* Note - as Python will defaul start and step args to 0 an 1, this loop can
  be expressed as 'for i in range(10): etc'

_______**
SLICES

Portion of a sequence, similar syntax as range()

given a sequence, seq, with a list of values

seq = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

seq[ start : stop : step ]

seq[1:4:1] will be interetpreted as 'take a slice of sequence 'seq',
starting with the first value, ending with the 4th value, incrementing 
by 1 each time

* Notes

    - slice method assumes if no values are given for start / stop / step
      points, the default vaules are the first val, last val, and 1

    - slice w/ step value of -1 will reverse a list

    - slice doesn't change the original sequence, it creates a new one

LEN, MIN, MAX

All built-in functions that will work on all sequences which contain all
elements of the same datatype )all numbers, all strings, etc)

len() - returns length of sequence passed as argument

min() - returns minimum value of sequence passed as argument

max() - returns largest value in sequence passed as argument


_______**

MEMBERSHIP TESTING

Whether or not an item or sequence is IN another sequence

docs = "any random string"

if 'random' in* docs:
    # do something
else:
    # do something else

* Note - also works as 'not in' - test condition will eval to true / false
 depending on what you're looking for as well

_______**

COUNT & INDEX


COUNT
    docs = "any random string"

    print(docs.count('target value'))
        returns int value of number of times the target 
        string or value is found in the target sequence(s)

    docs = "any random string"

INDEX
    print(docs.index('target value'))
        returns int value of the first index position of the 
        first appearance of the target value's appearance in the
        sequence passed to the .index() method.
        Note - only returns index value of FIRST instance of target value


_______**


CONCANTENATION

combining two objects together, for mutable sequences this will modify
one sequence, for immutable sequences this will need to create a NEW sequence
and is accomplished with the plus sign (+)

MULTIPLICATION

sequence name plus multiplication sign (*) and the (int) value to multiply it

DICTIONARIES

Intro / Info - set of key:value pairs, each hving a label (the key) which is the index
value of the associated value

    Syntax - wrapped in curly braces / separated by commas {key:value, key:value, key:value}
    Order of the key / value pairs does not matter

Accessing data inside the dictionary;
