RANGES

Range method will iterate from the start val to the stop val 
and step-thru by the step val.
Note - if no start val is passed or less than 3 args are passed, 
Python assumes starting point is 0, defaul step value is 1


range(start, stop, step)

for i in range(0,10,1)
    print(i)

Ranges are EXclusive of stop values, so the loop above will not run / output of 10,
only values 0 thru 9 will be printed.

* Note - as Python will defaul start and step args to 0 an 1, this loop can
  be expressed as 'for i in range(10): etc'

SLICES

Portion of a sequence, similar syntax as range()

given a sequence, seq, with a list of values

seq = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

seq[ start : stop : step ]

seq[1:4:1] will be interetpreted as 'take a slice of sequence 'seq',
starting with the first value, ending with the 4th value, incrementing 
by 1 each time

* Notes

    - slice method assumes if no values are given for start / stop / step
      points, the default vaules are the first val, last val, and 1

    - slice w/ step value of -1 will reverse a list

    - slice doesn't change the original sequence, it creates a new one
